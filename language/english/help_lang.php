<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>The events manager, by <a href="http://philsquarelabs.com" target="_blank">Philsquare Labs</a>, is a simple but powerful tool for creating and managing events. There are a few things you might want to do before you start to create your events.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we would recommend you go the the "Settings" panel an view all the available setting options for this module.</li>
<li>If you plan on using categories, visit the "Colors" and "Categories" sections and set them up appropriately to meet your needs.</li>
<li>Under the "Custom Fields" section you can define some addition fields that are specific to your event requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Registrations</h4>
<p>Registrations can be enabled in the "Settings" section of you admin panel. Once enabled you will be able to optional select your event to except registrations. Please note the the registrations require no account or login by the user. It simply collects a name and email. We plan on extending the functionality of registration in future version of Events Manager.</p>
<h4>Category Colors</h4>
<p>Currently, there is no color picker for the colors. You will have to update the colors using the HEX value. You can use other resources such as <a href="http://www.colorpicker.com/" target="_blank">www.colorpicker.com</a> to help get the codes.</p>
